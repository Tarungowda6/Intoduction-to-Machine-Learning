# Intoduction-to-Machine-Learning
this repository( case study) is a self dive into what and all are the core concepts, algorithms of machine learning 

What is Machine Learning?
"Learning is any process by which a system improves performance form experience"

By defination of Arthur Samuel [1959]
A field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed [or] is a study of algorithms that
*improve their performance P
*at some task T
*with experience E.
A well-defined learning task is given by <P,T,E>.

When Do We Use Machine Learning?
ML is used when:
* Human expertise does not exist [navigating on Mars]
* Humans can't explain their expertise [speech recognition]
* Models must be customized [personalized medicine]
* Models are based on huge amounts of data [genomics]

  A classic example of a task that requires machine learning:
  when you want to recognize the numbers or images that are hard to predict

Some more examples of tasks that that are best solved by using a learning algorithm

*Recognizing patterns:
-Facial identities or facial expressions
-Handwritten or spoken words
-Medical images

*Generating patterns:
-Generating images or motion sequences

*Recognizing anomalies:
-Unusual credit card transactions
-Unusual patterns of sensor readings in a nuclear power plant

*Prediction:
-Future stock or currency exchange rates


Sample Applications

* Web search
* Computational biology
* Finance
* E-commerce
* Space exploration
* Robotics
* Information extraction
* Social networks
* Debugging sofware
